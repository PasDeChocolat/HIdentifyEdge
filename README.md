A Hawai‘i community tech project.

## Usage

FIXME

### Help Wanted

* We need to prototype the UI used to associate "aliases" to "persons."
* We need an algorithm to rank prospective "aliases" as probably matches to "persons."
* We need volunteers with an interest in the data to associate contributions with aliases and unique persons. This is a research task, requiring people to use alternative forms of verification (name, address, occupation, etc.).
* We need to webify this application (adding users, authentication, logging, undo, etc.).
